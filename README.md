# Fair_User_Policy_Engine

Fair usage policies limit the data usage of one user over another at peak times so that the performance  is not affected for the rest of the group. Fair User Policy Engine implements this logic by fetching the data usages of data service subscribers from the database at real time and facilitate downgrading of the bandwith of the subscribers who has exceeded the configured threshold levels.
